## 🔧 Key Components

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Secure login with AsyncStorage persistence
const handleLogin = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  await AsyncStorage.setItem('isLoggedIn', 'true');
  await AsyncStorage.setItem('userEmail', email);
  router.replace('/(tabs)');
};
```

### Pokemon Data Integration
```typescript
// Real-time Pokemon data fetching
const fetchPokemons = async (offset = 0) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=21&offset=${offset}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  // Process and return Pokemon data
};
```

### Search Implementation
```typescript
// Dictionary-style search with API integration
const handleSearch = async (query: string) => {
  const matches = await searchPokemonAPI(query);
  return matches.slice(0, 10); // Limit for performance
};
```
